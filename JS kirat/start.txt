JS does not compile it's a interpretated language
so interpreted languages
    ->usually go line by line
    ->Can run partially if the error comes later(Whereas compiled lang does not run if there is an error)
    ->exm -- js,python

Single threaded nature of js:- It's always run across only a single core of machine at a time.
that's why it's considered a bad language for scalable systems.


Js run line by line means only one line will run at a time.
